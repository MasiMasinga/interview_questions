--- The query didnt return any results because SQL NOT IN operator is used to  filter the result if the values that are mentioned as part of the IN operator 
    is not satisfied. In that specific query the values that are not satisfied as part of the NOT IN because the column has a NULL value which will return an empty table. 


-- CORRECT QUERY
SELECT * 
FROM runners 
WHERE id NOT IN 
	     (SELECT winner_id FROM races WHERE winner_id IS NOT null)
